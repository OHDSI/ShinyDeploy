<h3>Terms of Use:</h3>
<p>These results are being shared as part of OHDSI's open science community efforts to study the comparative cardiovascular effectiveness and safety of treatments for diabetes under the LEGEND-T2DM initiative, for the purpose of enabling collaborative research within the community.
Synthesis of the results and interpretation of the findings is underway and manuscripts are being prepared.
All manuscripts must be reviewed and approved by all co-authors and data partner contributors prior to submission.
Until final publication, all results are to be considered preliminary and subject to change, and may only be used under the terms of use of the respective data partner contributors.</p>

**Objectives:**<br>
1) To determine, through systematic evaluation, the comparative effectiveness of traditionally second-line T2DM agents, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists, with each other and with DPP4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas, for cardiovascular outcomes. <br>
2) To determine, through systematic evaluation, the comparative safety of traditionally second-line T2DM agents among patients with T2DM. <br>
3) To assess heterogeneity in effectiveness and safety of traditionally second-line T2DM agents among key patient subgroups: Using stratified patient cohorts, we will quantify differential effectiveness and safety across subgroups of patients based on age, sex, race, renal impairment, and baseline cardiovascular risk. <br>
