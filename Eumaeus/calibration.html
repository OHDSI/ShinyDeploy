<p>In previous work we describe emprical calibration of <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.5925">p-values</a> and <a href = "https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2571.long"> confidence intervals</a>. Briefly, by observing the effect size estimates for negative and positive controls and considering the expected distribution given the true effect sizes and random error, we estimate a systematic error distribution. We assume this distribution is Gaussian with a mean and standard deviation linearly related to the logarithm of the true effect size. Using the estimated distribution, we then generate calibrated confidence intervals considering both random and systematic error. Typically, but not necessarily, the calibrated confidence interval is wider than the nominal confidence interval, reflecting the problems unaccounted for in the standard procedure (such as unmeasured confounding, selection bias and measurement error) but accounted for in the calibration.</p>

<p>Metrics can be viewed both with and without empirical calibration. When applying empirical calibration, we use a leave-one-out approach: for each control the error distributions are fitted on all controls except the control being calibrated and its siblings. By siblings we mean the set of a negative control and the positive controls derived from that negative control.</p>
