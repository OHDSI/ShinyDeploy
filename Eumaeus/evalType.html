We focus on population-level effect estimation, that is, the estimation of average causal effects of medical interventions on specific health outcomes of interest. We consider two different estimation tasks:
<ul>
<li>Direct effect estimation: estimating the effect of an exposure on the risk of an outcome, as compared to no exposure.</li>
<li>Comparative effect estimation: estimation the effect of one exposure (the target exposure) on the risk of an outcome, as compared to another exposure (the comparator exposure).</li>
</ul>
In both cases, the patient-level causual effect contrasts a factual outcome, i.e., what happened to the exposed patient, with a counterfactual outcome, i.e., what would have happened had the exposure not occurred (direct) or had a different exposure occurred (comparative). Since any one patient reveals only the factual outcome (the fundamental problem of causal inference), the various effect estimation methods employ analytic devices to shed light on the counterfactual outcomes.
