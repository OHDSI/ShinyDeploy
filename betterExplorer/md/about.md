<h3>About the BETTER study</h3>
<p>The study aims at developing a Bayesian alternative procedure to improve the performance of vaccine safety surveillance. Empirical evaluations based on large-scale observational healthcare databases are conducted to compare the proposed procedure against the state-of-art approach, MaxSPRT, with testing-oriented and estimation-oriented metrics. </p>

<p>These results are being shared as part of OHDSI's open science community efforts. 
Until final publication, all results are to be considered preliminary and subject to change, and may only be used under the terms of use of the respective data partner contributors.</p>

- See `Testing metrics` for results on Type 1 error rates, statistical power, and time-to-signal.
- See `Estimation metrics` for comparisons on estimation accuracy and quality, with mean squared errors (MSEs) and coverage rates of 95% CIs.
- See `Database information` and `Vaccine information` for details on databases and vaccine exposures.
