<p>Each of these cohorts were identified without any requirement for prior observation time, and also with the added restriction of having a minimum of 365 days of prior observation time available. CUIMC used a specific cohort definition for COVID-19, which accounted for local coding practice.SIDIAP included a further COVID=19 cohort where only individuals identified up to the end of March were included (where primary care linkage ended).</p>
