<h3>Description</h3>
  <p> The performance of the model including the operating characteristics at different risk cutoffs, the overall discrimination and the overall calibration. </p>
  
  <h3>Tabs</h3>
  <p>The three tabs are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The 'Summary' tab shows the prediction question being explores and various operating characteristics for a range of risk cutoffs (the threshold bar is interactive and enables you to explore different values by moving the bar left or right) </li>
  <li>The 'Discrimination' tab shows the AUROC, AUPRC, predicted risk distributions and F1 score</li>
  <li>The 'Calibration' tab shows the generic calibration plot and the calibration per age group and gender.</li>
  </ul>
