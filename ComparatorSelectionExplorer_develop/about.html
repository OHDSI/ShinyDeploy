<p>
To preseve patient privacy and ensure robust similarity estimation, available exposure cohorts are limited to those with 1,000 or more subjects.
In addition, covariates with prevalance below 1% are omitted from similarity calculations and their prevalence values are masked in the diagnostic tables.
If you feel any information in this utility may inadvertantly compromise patient privacy, please contact the authors.
