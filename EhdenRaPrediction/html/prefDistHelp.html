<h3>Description</h3>
  <p> These plots show the preference score density function for those with the outcome (red) and those without the outcome (green) </p>
  
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
  <p> If a prediction model is able to discriminate between those who and without the outcome during the time-at-risk then these distributions should be disjoint.  The more overlap between the distributions, the worse the discrimination. </p>
