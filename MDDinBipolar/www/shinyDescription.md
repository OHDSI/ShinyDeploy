### Abstract 

Below is the abstract of the manuscript that summarizes the findings:

**Background:**  Many patients with bipolar disorder (BD) are first diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD), and there are high prospective diagnosis conversion rates from MDD to BD. It is unknown whether MDD is a BD comorbidity or it is an earlier stage of BD.

**Methods:** IBM MarketScanÂ® CCAE, MDCR, MDCD, Optum EHR, and Optum Claims databases were analyzed. Patient inclusion criteria were: age >10 years; >= 1 year of observation prior to MDD onset; >=1 year of observation after MDD (or BD diagnosis transition earlier); no BD, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotropic use prior to MDD. Cyclops regularized logistic regression models were developed on one year MDD-BD conversion with all standard covariates from the patient level prediction package. A simple model was then derived, and time-to-conversion Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed up to a decade after MDD, stratified by score range. External validation of the model was performed across the OHDSI network.

**Results:** The model internal AUC ranged 0.633-0.745 depending on the database. Nine variables predicted one year MDD-BD transition: age at MDD onset; MDD severity; psychosis; comorbid mental disorder; anti-anxiety drugs; pregnancy; substance misuse; self-harm thoughts/actions. Each predictor was assigned a score with a higher score meaning greater conversion rate to MDD over time in the Kaplan-Meier models. Year-by-year AUC estimates trended stable to improving with time.

**Conclusions:** Our approach produced a simple, clinically understandable model that validates well across multiple international data sources. Some validation datasets had comparable AUCs to those of the training sets, and some were too small to assess -- further network study sites will be incorporated into the validation as IRB approvals are obtained.
