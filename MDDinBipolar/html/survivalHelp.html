<h3>Description</h3>
  <p> See the 10-year conversion based on out models predicted risk per database </p>
  
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
  <p> If the model is discrimiantive then the risk strata sould have different curves - with more coonversion in those assigned a higher risk.  This plot also shows the transition trend over time (does it converge suggesting transition slows down over time or is transition still occuring for many years?)</p>
