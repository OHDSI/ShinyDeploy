# CE11: Distribution of condition era end dates

## Description
This query is used to to provide summary statistics for condition era end dates (condition_era_end_date) across all condition era records: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in  blue

```sql
WITH ordered_data AS (
SELECT condition_concept_id,
       condition_era_end_date,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY condition_concept_id ORDER BY condition_era_end_date) order_nr,
       COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY condition_concept_id) AS population_size
  FROM @cdm.condition_era
 WHERE condition_concept_id IN ( 256723, 372906, 440377, 441202, 435371 )
), percentiles AS (
SELECT condition_concept_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .25 * population_size THEN DATEFROMPARTS(9999,1,1) ELSE condition_era_end_date END) AS pct_25,
       MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .50 * population_size THEN DATEFROMPARTS(9999,1,1) ELSE condition_era_end_date END) AS median,
       MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .75 * population_size THEN DATEFROMPARTS(9999,1,1) ELSE condition_era_end_date END) AS pct_75
  FROM ordered_data
 GROUP BY condition_concept_id
), aggregates AS (
SELECT condition_concept_id,
       MIN(condition_era_end_date) AS min_end_date,
       MAX(condition_era_end_date) AS max_end_date,
       -- Julian Date arithmetic doesn't seem natively supported by all RDBMS,
       -- using days since Jan 1 of Year 1 ('0001-01-01','YYYY-MM-DD') instead.
       DATEADD(d,AVG(CAST(DATEDIFF(day,DATEFROMPARTS(1,1,1),condition_era_end_date) AS FLOAT)),DATEFROMPARTS(1,1,1)) AS avg_end_date,
       ROUND(STDEV(CAST(DATEDIFF(day,DATEFROMPARTS(1,1,1),condition_era_end_date) AS FLOAT)),0) AS std_dev_days
  FROM @cdm.condition_era
 WHERE condition_concept_id IN  ( 256723, 372906, 440377, 441202, 435371 )
 GROUP BY condition_concept_id
 )
 SELECT a.condition_concept_id, a.min_end_date, a.max_end_date, a.avg_end_date, a.std_dev_days, p.pct_25, p.median, p.pct_75
   FROM aggregates a
   JOIN percentiles p
     ON a.condition_concept_id = p.condition_concept_id
  ORDER BY a.condition_concept_id;
```
