# C07: Find a pathogen by keyword

## Description
This query enables a search of all pathogens using a keyword as input. The resulting concepts could be used in query  C09 to identify diseases caused by a certain pathogen.

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query to list all pathogens specified using a keyword as input.

```sql
SELECT
  c.concept_id       AS pathogen_concept_id,
  c.concept_name     AS pathogen_concept_name,
  c.concept_code     AS pathogen_concept_code,
  c.concept_class_id AS pathogen_concept_class,
  c.standard_concept AS pathogen_standard_concept,
  c.vocabulary_id    AS pathogen_concept_vocab_id
FROM @vocab.concept AS c
WHERE
  lower(c.concept_class_id) = 'organism' AND
  lower(c.concept_name) LIKE '%trypanosoma%' AND
  c.invalid_reason IS NULL
;
```
## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Keyword for pathogen |  'Trypanosoma' |  Yes | Keyword should be placed in a single quote |

## Output

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- |
|  Pathogen_Concept_ID |  Concept ID of SNOMED-CT pathogen concept |
|  Pathogen_Concept_Name |  Name of SNOMED-CT pathogen concept with keyword entered as input |
