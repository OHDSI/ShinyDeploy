# C11: Find all SNOMED-CT condition concepts that are occurring at an anatomical site

## Description
This query accepts a SNOMED-CT body structure ID as input and returns all conditions occurring in the anatomical site, which can be identified using query  C10.

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query to list conditions located in the anatomical site.

```sql
SELECT
  a.concept_id       AS condition_id,
  a.concept_name     AS condition_name,
  a.concept_code     AS condition_code,
  a.concept_class_id AS condition_class,
  a.vocabulary_id    AS condition_vocab_id,
  d.concept_id       AS anatomical_site_id,
  d.concept_name     AS anatomical_site_name,
  d.concept_code     AS anatomical_site_code,
  d.concept_class_id AS anatomical_site_class,
  d.vocabulary_id    AS anatomical_site_vocab_id
FROM @vocab.concept_relationship AS cr
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS a ON cr.concept_id_1 = a.concept_id
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS d ON cr.concept_id_2 = d.concept_id
WHERE
  cr.relationship_id = 'Has finding site' AND
  d.concept_id = 4103720 AND
  cr.invalid_reason IS NULL
;
```
