# C04: Translate a MedDRA concept into a SNOMED-CT concept

## Description
This query accepts a MedDRA concept ID as input and returns details of the equivalent SNOMED-CT concepts.
The existing relationships in the vocabulary associate MedDRA 'Preferred Term' to SNOMED-CT 'clinical findings'. The respective hierarchy for MedDRA and SNOMED-CT can be used to traverse up and down the hierarchy of each of these individual vocabularies.

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query to list all MedDRA concepts that have SNOMED-CT equivalents.

```sql
SELECT
  d.concept_id         AS meddra_concept_id,
  d.concept_name       AS meddra_concept_name,
  d.concept_code       AS meddra_concept_code,
  d.concept_class_id   AS meddra_concept_class,
  cr.relationship_id   AS relationship_id,
  r.relationship_name  AS relationship_name,
  a.concept_id         AS snomed_concept_id,
  a.concept_name       AS snomed_concept_name,
  a.concept_code       AS snomed_concept_code,
  a.concept_class_id   AS snomed_concept_class
FROM @vocab.concept_relationship AS cr
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS d ON cr.concept_id_1 = d.concept_id
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS a ON cr.concept_id_2 = a.concept_id
  JOIN @vocab.relationship AS r ON cr.relationship_id = r.relationship_id
WHERE
  cr.relationship_id = 'MedDRA - SNOMED eq' AND
  cr.concept_id_1 = 35205180 AND
  cr.invalid_reason IS NULL
;
```
