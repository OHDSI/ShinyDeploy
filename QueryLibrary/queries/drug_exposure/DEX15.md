```sql
WITH statins AS (
SELECT descendant_concept_id AS concept_id
  FROM @vocab.concept_ancestor
 WHERE ancestor_concept_id = 1539403
), statin_users AS (
SELECT de.person_id, MIN(de.drug_exposure_start_date) AS index_date
  FROM @cdm.drug_exposure de
  JOIN statins s
    ON de.drug_concept_id = s.concept_id
 GROUP BY de.person_id
)    
SELECT FLOOR(1.0*DATEDIFF(d,su.index_date,op.observation_period_end_date)/365) AS follow_up_years,
       COUNT(*) AS persons
       /* statin users with 180 clean period and at least 1 year follow up period */
  FROM statin_users su
  JOIN @cdm.observation_period op
    ON su.person_id  = op.person_id
 WHERE DATEADD(d,180,op.observation_period_start_date) < su.index_date
   AND op.observation_period_end_date                  > DATEADD(d,365,su.index_date)
 GROUP BY FLOOR(1.0*DATEDIFF(d,su.index_date,op.observation_period_end_date)/365)
 ORDER BY 1;
```
