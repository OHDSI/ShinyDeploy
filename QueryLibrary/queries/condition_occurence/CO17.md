# CO17: Distribution of condition occurrence records per person

## Description
This query is used to provide summary statistics for the number of condition occurrence records (condition_occurrence_id) for all persons: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. There is no input required for this query.

## Query
