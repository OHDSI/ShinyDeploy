### OHDSI PatientLevelPrediction Model Repository

This shiny application is an interface for viewing, uploading and downloading healthcare prediction models. 

Our aim is to improve the reproducibility and transparency of prediction models.  Reproducibiliy is improved by the ability to access code that can be run against any OMOP common data model data to implement and evaluate any model in this repository. Transparency is improved by providing all the details for the model development and performance within the app. This will help us decide which models to trust by examining extensive external validation results. 

### How to use?

Click on the 'Library' option in the left-hand menu to explore the models in the repository.  You can select a model to explore further by selecting the corresponding row in the library table.  This will then populate the settings/performance/model views.

### How to download a model?

Click on the 'download development' to download an R package that can be executed on any OMOP common data model data to replicate the model development process in your data.   Click the 'download validation' to download an R package that can be executed on any OMOP common data model data to validate the choosen model in your data.  You can then upload the new model or validation results to the repo.

### How to upload results?
