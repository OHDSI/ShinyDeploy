### OHDSI Covid-19 Simple Models Results

The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) international community is hosting a COVID-19 virtual study-a-thon this week (March 26-29) to inform healthcare decision-making in response to the current global pandemic. The preliminary research results on this web-based application are from a retrospective, real-world, observational study in support of this activity and will subsequently be submitted to a peer-reviewed, scientific journal. 

This shiny application contains the results of the simple models that were developed to assess the performance loss that occurs on various OHDSI COVID19 prediction problems.

During manuscript development and the subsequent review period, these results are considered under embargo and should not be disclosed without explicit permission and consent from the authors.

Below are links for study-related artifacts that have been made available as part of this study:

### App Instructions

Click on the 'Summary' button in the left hand menu to see a table where each row corresponds to a result where a model has been valdiated on some data.  Clicking on a row then populates the 'Performance' and 'Model' buttons with that specific result (you can view more details of the evaluation that the row corresponds to).  See the 'Help' button for a youtube video demostrating the shiny app.
